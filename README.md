# Welcome to Neovim!
Hello, this is my Neovim config!
This is my first time getting setup with nvim!
As such I've implemented some keybindings and such that replicate keybindings I'm used to in other editors.
Read on for some info!

## Telescope
N - 'CTRL + P' | Open Telescope
N - 'CTRL + F' | Live Grep

## Harpoon
N - 'LEADER + A' | Add current buffer to Harpoon.
N - 'CTRL + A' | Open Harpoon.
Inside Harpoon: I - 'DEL' | Delete the currently selected Harpoon entry.

## Floating Console
N - 'CTRL + T' | Toggle console. If an instance doesn't exist it will be created.
Inside Console: I - 'ESC' | Teardown console instance.
